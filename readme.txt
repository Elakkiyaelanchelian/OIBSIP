data science projects implemented in Python, focusing on the Iris dataset, unemployment trends in India, and email spam detection.

1. Iris Dataset Analysis
Objective: Analyze the Iris dataset to classify different species of Iris flowers.
Tasks:

Data Exploration: Investigate the dataset to understand the distribution of features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
Data Visualization: Create visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to illustrate relationships between features and species.
Model Building: Implement classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) to predict the species of Iris flowers.
Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
2. Unemployment in India
Objective: Analyze unemployment trends in India.
Tasks:

Data Collection: Gather data from various sources, including government reports and online datasets.
Data Cleaning: Preprocess the data to handle missing values and outliers.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to uncover insights about unemployment rates across different states, age groups, and educational backgrounds.
Trend Analysis: Analyze trends over time to understand changes in unemployment rates and forecast future rates.
3. Email Spam Detection
Objective: Classify emails as spam or not spam.
Tasks:

Data Collection: Use publicly available datasets of labeled emails.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the text data by removing stop words and applying stemming.
Feature Engineering: Create features to distinguish between spam and non-spam emails.
Model Training: Train and evaluate classification models (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines) for high accuracy.
